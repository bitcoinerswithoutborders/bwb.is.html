          <div class="clear-both">
            <p>Are you dreaming of a better day? Live it. <span class="added">We are not idealists, we are makers manifesting ideals.</span> Help us make things. Happen.</p>
            <p>We want to see widespread acceptance and use of a global transaction currency that levels the playing field, and reflects the society we live in TODAY, rather than hold on to centuries old paradigms about what a currency is or can be.
            <p>We want to take the pseudonymous, decentralized, private, and encrypted power of crypto currency off of the internet, and put it into people's hands, so they can use it to make small, daily transactions. To buy bread, or a couple of beers for a friend. Or the legendary pizza.</p>
            <p class="added">We are committed to both <a target="utopia" href="http://github.com/bitcoinerswithoutborders">open source and transparent code bases</a> for our products and services, as well as peer review and <a target="utopia" href="http://metalab.at">community participation</a>. We also think it is ok to make a profit providing services and products for crypto currencies. We do not think that these two worlds - open source and profit making - contradict each other - as long as it is honest. Bitcoin is not a Blood Diamond. Nor is it Gold, the product of oppression, slavery, thievery, or wars. </p>
            <p class="added">Bitcoin is, as <a target="utopia" href="http://twitter.com/leashless">Swami Havabanana </a>says, 'the first karmically clean currency'.</p>
